## ‚úÖ You Can Create a PR If:

1. ‚úÖ Development server runs fine (`npm run dev` works)
2. ‚úÖ All pages display with new design
3. ‚úÖ Light and dark modes both work
4. ‚úÖ No console errors in browser
5. ‚úÖ Responsive design works on different screen sizes

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues to Ignore:

### **Production Build Error**

```
Error: Unexpected end of JSON input
```

**This is NOT your fault!** This error exists because:

- The app needs a database connection to build
- Database setup is not part of UI contribution
- Maintainers will fix this separately

### **CSS Warnings (Safe to Ignore)**

```
Unknown at rule @apply
text-wrap is not supported by...
```

These are:

- Editor warnings only
- Code works perfectly in browsers
- Not actual errors
