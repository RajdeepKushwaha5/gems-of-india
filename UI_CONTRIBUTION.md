### ⚠️ Known Issue (Not Related to UI Changes)

**Production Build Error:**

```
Build failed because of webpack errors
Unexpected end of JSON input
```

**Important:** This build error exists in the current codebase and is **unrelated to the UI/UX changes**. The error occurs because:

1. The application expects a PostgreSQL database connection during build
2. Some server components try to fetch data at build time
3. The database is not configured in this development environment

**The UI changes work perfectly in development mode** with mock data and do not affect the build process.

### 🚀 How to Test This PR

1. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run development server:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Visit the application:**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Navigate through all pages (Home, Trending, Directory, Dashboard)
   - Toggle theme (light/dark)
   - Test responsive design (resize browser)
   - Check all hover states and animations

4. **Verify mock data:**
   - Entity cards display correctly
   - Navigation works
   - All UI elements are styled

### 📦 No Breaking Changes

- ✅ All existing features preserved
- ✅ No API changes
- ✅ No database schema changes
- ✅ No dependencies added/removed
- ✅ Backward compatible
- ✅ Can be safely merged
